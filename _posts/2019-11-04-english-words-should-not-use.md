# odd -> weird

That's a little bit weird.

1, 3, 5, 7, they are odd numbers.

# Don't mention it -> Don't remind me

Andrew, I heard your ex-girlfriend is dating Justin Bieber.

Don't remind me.



Andrew, thanks for doing this.

Don't mention it.

# seldom -> barely, rarely

I rarely hear the word "seldom" used.

# treat you -> my treat

This is my treat. 

Don't use treat as a verb.

# supper -> dinner

If you are under 60 years old, use "supper", don't use "dinner".

# May I -> Can I

You can use "Can I" instead of "May I" for everything.

"May I" is just a little bit outdated.

# Have a rest -> Take a break

Take a break.
