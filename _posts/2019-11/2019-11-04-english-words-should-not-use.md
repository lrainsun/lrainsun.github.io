Why it is easier to understand things that you hear, but harder to say them back?

Here are two pieces of advice:

1. If you want to remember something, you need to explain it to somebody else.  

   When you are listening, you are just learning passively. Things are going into your passive memory. 

   But when you explain something to someone else, it has to be from your ACTIVE memory, from your active vocabulary. And when things are coming out, that is when you remember it. 

2. When you guess something, When you take a guess and you get it correct.. by accident, you never forget this. And I think this is completely true. It's like when you guess something and you're like ￣□￣｜｜ and then it turns out to be right. 



So, take **MORE** risks and care **LESS** about making mistakes.
