I have a strong desire to review "Friends" tonight. 

# I'll be There for You

So no one told you life was gonna be this way.

Your jobs a joke, you're broke, your love life's D.O.A (dead on arrival).

It's like you're always stuck in second gear.

And it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year, but

I'll be there for you, 

when the rain starts to pour.

I'll be there for you,

like I've been there before.

I'll be there for you,

'cause you're there for me too.
